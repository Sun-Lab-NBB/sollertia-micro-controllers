 * @note By default, the clockwise (CW) movement of the encoder is measured as a negative displacement, while the

 *
 * @tparam kPinA the digital interrupt pin connected to the 'A' channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kPinB the digital interrupt pin connected to the 'B' channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kPinX the digital pin connected to the 'X' (index) channel of the quadrature encoder.
 * @tparam kInvertDirection determines whether to invert the sign of the value returned by the encoder.
